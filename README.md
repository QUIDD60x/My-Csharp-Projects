This is a compendium (and a proof of knowledge) of my C# projects. They're nothing special, just random programs each containing some different function of C# I wanted to practice.

Feel free to use these however you'd like! They're nothing extravagant, and I may update them occasionally, but I'm typically busy making new ones.
